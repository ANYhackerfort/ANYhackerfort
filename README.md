# ðŸ’» Hello, I am a Computer Science and Statistics student at the University of California, Santa Barbara

I'm passionate about creating realistic 3D controls modeled after the real world. My work focuses on developing interactive systems where virtual actions update physical devices in real timeâ€”and vice versaâ€”bridging the gap between digital and physical environments.

Moreover, I'm deeply fascinated by predictive modeling, harnessing the power of Agents and LLMs to uncover insights and drive intelligent decision-making (modeling humans in a pandemic etc..).  I also love blending AI with real-world applications, whether itâ€™s designing seamless workflows, optimizing processes, or crafting tools that bring ideas to life.

Lastly, when it comes to 2D, building node-based software is a passion of mine, the intuitiveness and interactivness of a node-based system empower users to be creative and explore with their domain knowledge, without the need for writing code.
